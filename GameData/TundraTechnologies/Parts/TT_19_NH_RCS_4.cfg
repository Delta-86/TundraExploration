	manufacturer = Tundra Technologies
	description = A tiny RCS block designed to fire in 4 directions, however, these directions may not always be the ones desired at a moment's notice. The best use of this thing is to attach it in 2x symmetry, then attach RC-TT-0201 in 2x symmetry perpendicular to this for a 4-way arrangement. They look like Peter P. Kerman's hands when he tested a flick activated device and somehow broke his fingers. Who designed these anyway? Was it him?
