description = Designed for constallation satellites, this antenna is small and focused, allowing more than enough direct control range for unmanned vessels deployed in low orbit. It exceeds the Communotron 16 iteration and apparently, our home planet's influence. It can escape and come back but we'd rather it not escape.
