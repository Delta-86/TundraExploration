title = Communotron 04 Aviation Relay Antenna
manufacturer = Tundra Technologies
description = A very low-powered radio device, and designed in part by the Scientific Committee on Advanced Navigation, the 04 has little to do that grants an immediate and large benefit. It prefers to focus on airplanes to provide in-flight internet connection but can also serve as a low resolution geology scanner.
