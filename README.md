# TundraExploration
This mod was originally created by @tygoo7 and will be continued by me. Tundra Exploration will continue to focus on stock-alike SpaceX and various other space related parts in KSP. Expect many more parts to be added in the future. If you have any suggestions, please leave a comment

# Current parts

- Rodan command pod, heatshield, and trunk. It also has a nice IVA included. (Dragon V2)
- Ghidorah 9 fuel tanks, second stage engine, first stage engine, legs, grid fins, and decoupler (Falcon 9)
- Gigan pod, heatshield, shroud, trunk, solar panel, solar shroud. (Cargo Dragon)
- Gojira command pod with fuel tank, engine shroud and engines (SpaceX's BFS)
- Gojira BFT-9000 Fuel Tank, engines and probe core (SpaceX's BFR)
- Revamp Ghidorah 9 textures (includes a brand new version as well as a landed/reused one) (Needs B9 Part Switch)
- Mothra Launcher (Falcon 1)
- Ghidorah Heavy Parts

No IVA on Gojira, but coming in future update

#Known issues

- Landing Gojira might be hard. A guide is being made to teach you how to use Gojira.
- Caution using Gojira for stations, it can wobble and break it. Use "Autostruts" on Gojira for a temporary fix!
- Cargo Gojira's textures are weird (I haven't redone the model yet)
